Building
Build the app for production to the build folder.

# npm run build
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can also preview the built application locally as follows:

# npm install -g serve # if not installed yet
serve -s build

# Deployment (GitHub Pages)
A GitHub Action will automatically deploy the project to GitHub Pages on every push.

The workflow will build the project using npm and output the result to the dist folder which will be then pushed to the gh-pages branch.

See the details in .github/workflows/gh-pages-deploy.yml
