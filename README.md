movie-island Application + React + Bootstrap
This is a simple movie search project inspired by a tutorial to demonstrate the basics of React framework and its core concepts.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Unfortunately the API is using 'http; not 'https' so GitHub's security is not allowing the API call. below is an image of how the application would be working if the API calls are allowed.
