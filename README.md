# movie-island

This is a simple movie search project inspired by a tutorial to demonstrate the basics of React framework and its core concepts.

(This project was bootstrapped with Create React App)

Unfortunately the API is using 'http' not 'https' so GitHub's security is not allowing the API call meaning no content will show on the GitHub Pages. below is an image of how the application would be working if the API calls were allowed. 

This image shows what would be returned if the user searched 'superman'.
